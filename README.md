# Cosa Nostra

Cosa Nostra is a fictional Pizzeria we create for a HAVO Computer Science Final Project. The website consists of three parts: the website (where people can order their pizzas), the kitchen backend (where the cooks can see which pizza are order and give a deliverer the task to deliver the pizzas) and the delivererapp (where the deilverer can see which pizza he need to deliver and where).
